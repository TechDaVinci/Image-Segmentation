# Image-Segmentation

**Enhanced Convolutional Methods for Image Segmentation Study**

This repository contains code and resources for studying enhanced convolutional methods in image segmentation architectures using PyTorch.

## Objective

Explore image semantic segmentation architectures (Unet, AttenUnet, Unet++, Capsule-Net) by replacing standard convolutions with ten types of convolutions:

1. Standard
2. Spatially Separable
3. Gaussian Dynamic
4. Deformable
5. Adaptive Deformable
6. Standard Asymmetric
7. Asymmetric
8. Gaussian Dynamic Asymmetric
9. Deformable Asymmetric
10. Adaptive Deformable Asymmetric
